I'm alone, sitting with my broken glass
My four walls follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train, I emerged in London rain
And you waiting there swimming through apologies

I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember the soldier standing next to me
Riding on the metro

I was smiling as you took my hand
Saw the moon we spoke in France
You were past the shallow words
Years have passed and still I hurt
You were past the shallow words
Years have passed and still I hurt
I can see you now, smiling as I pulled away
Sorry

I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
"I love you always" filled my eyes
I remember the night we walked along the Seine
Riding on the metro

I remember a feeling coming over me
The soldier turned, then walked away
Fuck you for loving me
Riding on the metro
